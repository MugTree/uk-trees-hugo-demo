The UK is home to a diverse range of tree species, many of which play crucial roles in the country's ecosystems, culture, and history. From towering oaks and elegant ash trees to resilient pines and graceful elms, British woodlands offer habitats for countless wildlife species. These trees help stabilize soil, regulate local climates, and support biodiversity by providing food and shelter for insects, birds, and mammals. Native trees like oak and beech are especially vital, as they have evolved alongside local fauna, fostering symbiotic relationships that benefit the entire ecosystem.
