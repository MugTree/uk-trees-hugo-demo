Pine trees are evergreen conifers characterized by their needle-like leaves bundled in clusters called fascicles. They range widely in size and shape, from tall, straight pines used for timber to smaller, bushy pines in alpine regions. Pine wood is versatile and used in construction, furniture making, and paper production. Pine trees are important in forest ecosystems, providing shelter for wildlife and their seeds are a food source for birds and small mammals.
