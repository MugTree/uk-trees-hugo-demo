Elm trees are a group of deciduous trees known for their broad, arching canopies and serrated, oval-shaped leaves. They have been a part of urban landscapes for centuries, particularly in Europe and North America, due to their attractive form and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions. Elms can reach impressive heights, often growing up to 30 meters (100 feet) or more, with a lifespan of several hundred years. The wood of elm trees is strong, flexible, and resistant to splitting, making it valuable for furniture, boatbuilding, and even in the construction of water pipes in the past.

However, elms have faced significant challenges due to Dutch Elm Disease (DED), a fungal infection spread by bark beetles that devastated elm populations, especially in the 20th century. This disease has wiped out millions of elm trees, particularly in North America and Europe, where they were once common in streets, parks, and forests. Despite this, elms remain ecologically important, providing shelter and food for various wildlife, including birds and insects. Efforts are ongoing to breed disease-resistant elm varieties and restore their presence in urban and natural environments.
