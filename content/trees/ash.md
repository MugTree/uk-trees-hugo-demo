Ash trees are known for their graceful appearance and compound leaves consisting of several leaflets. They are deciduous trees that often grow tall, with a straight trunk and a spreading crown. Ash wood is valued for its strength and elasticity, making it ideal for furniture, tool handles, and sports equipment. Ash trees are also significant ecologically, providing habitat and food for various insects and birds.
