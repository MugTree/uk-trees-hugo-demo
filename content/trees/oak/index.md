Oak trees are deciduous or evergreen trees known for their strong wood and distinctive lobed leaves. They are long-lived and slow-growing, with a dense, durable wood that is prized for furniture, flooring, and barrels for aging wine and whiskey. Oak forests support a wide range of biodiversity, providing food and shelter for insects, birds, and mammals. Oaks have cultural significance in many societies and are often revered for their longevity and resilience.
