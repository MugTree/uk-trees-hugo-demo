Fir trees are tall, coniferous evergreens with needle-like leaves attached singly to the branches. They are known for their symmetrical shape and dense foliage, making them popular as Christmas trees. Fir wood is light, strong, and used in construction, especially for framing and plywood. Fir trees are important in mountainous and boreal forests, providing habitat for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization.
